# *Aero Web Framework*

A modern web framework, with all the batteries included you would expect.
Aero draws heavy inspiration from the Ruby based [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) (RoR) web framework.
If you already know RoR, developing with Aero should be a breeze.

### Known limitations

This is still a very new framework and hence it's functionality can be limited in some ways

* The `RouteHelpers` class used for constructing routes is very simplistic, and I'm certain there are tons of edge cases not accounted for

### TODO

* Add more intelligent reloading and server restarts, no reason to restart the whole server because a view changed
